## ⤴️ Motivation
I just want a safe space/home for developers and tech lovers like me to share and have fun, share the most crazy/exciting projects we are currently  working on, browse and connect with local developers plus keep in touch with my mates in a tech, geeky, nerdy way✌🏾

See what my friends are up to and working on, from screeling about having a bad day debugging some jsx code in my basement ...to figuring out how to setup a Docker container!

If that sounds a lot like, you... Welcome **Home** 🏠
